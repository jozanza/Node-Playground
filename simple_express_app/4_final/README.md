Simple Express App -- Part IV
=============================
If you did everything correctly, you should now have a working node app that looks something like this directory. Good work! Now go play around in the 'routes' and 'views' directories :D

Protip: Use 'node-dev' to run your app
--------------------------------------
If you run your app using the 'node' command as you most likely have been throughout this walkthrough, stop your server and restart it with the following command:

    $ node-dev app
    # Runs your Node app in dev mode
    
Now instead of having to stop/restart your app each time you make a change to your server code, Node will automatically stop/restart for you each time you save.
