Simple Express App -- Part II
=============================
Next, run the following:

    $ npm install express --save
    # Reads package.json and downloads/updates this project's dependent modules
    # (The --save flag puts express as a dependency in your package.json file)
    
In your project folder, you will now have a node_module directory with the express module inside.
