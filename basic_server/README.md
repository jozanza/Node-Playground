Running a Basic Node.js Server
==============================
In Terminal, navigate to the directory containing server.js, and run the following code:

    $ node server.js
    # This will start your node server on port 3000 of localhost

Next, open a web browser and go to localhost:3000. You should see 'Hello World!'. Take a look at the comments in server.js for more info about what's going on in that file.
